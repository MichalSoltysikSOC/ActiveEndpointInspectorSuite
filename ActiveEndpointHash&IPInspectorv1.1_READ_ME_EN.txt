## v1.1 - Release Notes:

(1) User interface and visibility improvements:

- Added a persistent color legend explaining row semantics.
- Introduced two distinct row background colors:

  * Light green - baseline processes, connections, services, scheduled tasks, or autostart entries collected during the initial scan.
  * Light red - processes, connections, services, scheduled tasks, or autostart entries detected after the baseline was established.

- Row coloring is applied consistently across scans to clearly distinguish baseline state from post-baseline changes.

(2) Process Command Line visibility:

- Added a new Process Command Line column to the Active SHA-256 Hash Checker tab in Active Endpoint Hash & IP Inspector.
- Added the same Process Command Line column to the standalone Active SHA-256 Hash Checker tool.
- Command lines are normalized and displayed consistently:

  * Quotation marks around executable paths are removed.
  * Executable paths are always expanded to full paths when available.
  * Original process arguments are preserved and appended after the resolved executable path.
  * Ensures uniform and reliable command line representation across all processes.

(3) Investigation and forensic value:

- Provides full process command line visibility, allowing analysts to see exactly how each process was launched, including arguments and execution context.
- Enables easier identification of suspicious execution patterns and reliable distinction between baseline activity and post-baseline changes.
- Strengthens baseline-driven endpoint analysis by clearly highlighting newly introduced artifacts while keeping the inspection strictly read-only and safe for live systems.
